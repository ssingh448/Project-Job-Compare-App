Updated V2. 
 
**Author**: Team 166
 
## 1 Testing Strategy 
 
### 1.1 Overall strategy 
 
The overall strategy that we will be using is unit-testing. We will create a test suite contains several automated test cases to test out the app functions. In particularly, we will carry out the testing on the following activities, (1) adding and editing current job, (2) adding job offers and comparing newly added job offer with current job, (3) adjusting comparison settings, (4) validating the order of job list, (5) comparing two selected jobs side-by-side. We will also conduct a basic automated navigation testing to ensure all the buttons and navigations are working as expected. Lastly, we will also be doing tests to ensure data persists after the app is killed. Please find more details in the section 2.
 
### 1.2 Test Selection 
 
We will be leveraging the white-box technique to conduct the test cases. Since this app does not have complicated business logic or user interface, we don't see the need to include any black-box technique in our test plan and we believe with sole white-box testing technique should be sufficed. In addition, we will also conduct manual testing as well.
 
### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion 
 
We will be leveraging functional coverage technique to assess the quality of test cases. In another words, we make sure that the test cases that we created will be able to cover all the functions that are provided in the app.  
 
### 1.4 Bug Tracking 
 
Since we are using Github to host our code, we will also be using the Github Issues feature to track any bugs and enhancement requests. We will be using labels to differentiate whether it is an actual bug or is an enhancement request and assign the issue to the developer who will be working on that part. After the issue is fixed or a new enhancement is delivered, we will close the issue.    
 
### 1.5 Technology 

We will be leveraging Android JUnit framework and Espresso framework for both automated unit and UI testing. As for manual testing, we will load the apk into emulator and perform the testing manually.
